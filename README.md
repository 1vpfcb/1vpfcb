#### Hey there, fellow devs 👾 <br>
Welcome to my corner of GitHub — where tests break before your code does 💥<br>
I'm a Quality Assurance Engineer with a sharp eye for bugs, a love for clean automation, and a mission to break things before users do.<br>
I script tests like poetry, hunt bugs like a sniper, and live for that green ✅ on the CI pipeline. <br>

Whether it's UI quirks or backend gremlins, I’ve got the test case ready.
